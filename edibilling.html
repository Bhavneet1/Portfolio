                                    <p>escoADVISOR help ESCOs in resolving AR aging issue by identifying delinquent accounts and analyze the  820 payment Edi files with corresponding meter readings i.e. 867 and invoice i.e. 810 created by Edi vendor. We have cloud based APIs {Application Programming Interface} solution that can integrate with EDi service provider and generate the error. At the same time, we do check at account level balance error to give correct resolution to an ESCO.</p>
