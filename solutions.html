                                    <p>To succeed, we have Microsoft certified software professional(s) who gained EDi/Billing knowledge by working as software architect/developers across all the EDI transactions i.e. 814,867,810,824,820,650,997,568,248. Our team gained EDI expertise by working on raw EDI files and digitally transform the data as per the ESCO needs. So, we have expertise in all inbound and outbound transactions files and analyze the EDi issues before happening to our customers.</p>
